Child's pig, but father's bacon.
Children and fools speak the truth.
Children and fools have merry lives.
Children and chickens must be always picking.
Children are poor men's riches.
Children should hear, see, and say nothing.
When children stand quiet they have done some harm.
Children are certain cares, but very uncertain comforts.
Children suck the mother when they are young, and the
